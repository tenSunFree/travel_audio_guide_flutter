## Introduction

Travel audio guide app with local content caching, offline browsing, audio download, offline playback, and a built-in media player, built using Riverpod, Drift, and Clean Architecture.

This project is for learning and technical practice.

See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for release history.

---

## Related Backend

This app connects to a Go backend for profile management:
- [travel-audio-guide-go](https://github.com/tenSunFree/travel-audio-guide-go)

The backend provides a RESTful API built with Go, chi, PostgreSQL, pgxpool, sqlc, Supabase JWT (ES256/JWKS), and Docker.
It handles JWT verification and user profile management.

## Features

### Travel Content

- Browse attractions, audio guides, and activities from the Taipei Travel Open API
- Home page displays time-based recommendations, currently open attractions, and ongoing activities with direct navigation to filtered list views
- View attraction and activity detail pages with HTML description rendering
- Display activity metadata including event period, organizer, venue, ticket information, and related links
- Tap venue phone numbers to launch the native dialer
- Open external links and related URLs via `url_launcher`
- Network images loaded with disk caching and pixel-ratio-aware memory decoding to reduce redundant downloads and memory usage

### Offline-First Experience

- Cache-first architecture: serve content from the local Drift database instantly, then refresh from remote APIs
- Paginated API synchronization with upsert to keep local data up to date
- Offline browsing for previously synced travel content
- Reactive UI updates driven by Drift DAO streams
- Skeleton loading placeholders while remote data is loading and the local cache is empty

### Audio Guide

### Activity Integration

- Add activity dates to the native calendar as all-day events
- Correctly handle long-running exhibitions by applying an end-date offset for iOS all-day calendar events
- Share activity details through the native system share sheet

### Filtering and UX

- Sort and filter bottom sheets for attractions, audio guides, and activities
- Attraction list supports open status filter (currently open) and time slot recommendation filter (morning / afternoon / evening / night)
- Activity list supports activity status filter (all / currently available / coming soon within 7 days)
- Home section action buttons navigate directly to filtered list pages with query parameters
- Active filter summary bars showing current filter conditions
- Consistent loading, empty state, and error state handling across all list pages

### Architecture

- Clean Architecture with separation of data, domain, and presentation layers
- Feature-first project structure
- State management with `flutter_riverpod`
- Immutable domain entities, API models, and UI states with Freezed
- Local persistence with Drift and generated DAOs
- HTTP client with Dio and centralized request / response logging via Talker
- Type-safe Android native method channels generated with Pigeon
- Selected Clean Architecture boundaries and team conventions are enforced at analysis time through a project-owned Dart Analyzer Plugin (`packages/app_lints`) rather than relying solely on documentation and code review — see [Architecture Enforcement](#architecture-enforcement)

### Testing

- Unit tests for domain use cases and data repositories across activity, attraction, and audio guide features
- Mocked repository, remote data source, and local data source dependencies with `mocktail`
- Verified Model → Entity mapping, pagination behavior, download flow, local file existence checks, and exception propagation
- Widget tests for `AudioGuideListPage` covering loading state, populated list, empty state, error state, download/play button rendering, AppBar display, and reactive stream updates
- Widget tests for `AudioGuideTile` and `ConditionSummaryBar` covering display states, label rendering, reset button visibility, and tap callback behavior
- Shared test infrastructure in `test/test_helpers` with reusable entity fixtures, fake remote data sources, in-memory Drift database setup with provider overrides, and a fake playback service for isolating audio controller tests
- Local CI check script (`scripts/check.sh`) — run automatically via the `pre-push` hook — validates formatting, static analysis, tests with coverage enabled, and a staging debug APK build, and verifies that `coverage/lcov.info` is generated and contains valid source-file records
- Local coverage tooling (`scripts/coverage.sh`) generates LCOV coverage data and an HTML coverage report via `genhtml` or `lcov-viewer` for file-by-file and line-by-line inspection
- Test coverage is tracked via Codecov and uploaded automatically from CI (`flutter test --coverage` → `coverage/lcov.info`)

### Code Quality

- Static analysis baseline upgraded from `flutter_lints` to [`very_good_analysis`](https://pub.dev/packages/very_good_analysis) (10.2.0), a stricter, community-adopted Dart/Flutter lint set
- Generated files (`*.g.dart`, `*.freezed.dart`, per-flavor Firebase config) are excluded from analysis to keep signal-to-noise high
- Static analysis runs through the standard `flutter analyze` command; the standalone `packages/app_lints` package resolves its own dependencies before analysis in both CI and `scripts/check.sh`
- Lint violations are enforced in CI (`Static analysis` step in `ci.yml`) and locally via `scripts/check.sh` and the `pre-push` git hook
- A project-owned [`analysis_server_plugin`](https://pub.dev/packages/analysis_server_plugin)-based analyzer plugin (`packages/app_lints`) enforces selected Clean Architecture dependency rules and team naming/logging conventions directly inside `flutter analyze` — see [Architecture Enforcement](#architecture-enforcement)
- `pubspec.yaml` dependency ordering is enforced by the built-in `sort_pub_dependencies` lint and can be auto-fixed on demand by `scripts/quality/sort_pubspec_dependencies.py`

### Architecture Enforcement

The project includes a custom [`analysis_server_plugin`](https://pub.dev/packages/analysis_server_plugin)-based Dart Analyzer Plugin under `packages/app_lints/`.

It converts selected architecture boundaries and team conventions into diagnostics reported directly through the standard analyzer pipeline. The same rules are available during local development and enforced by the existing `flutter analyze` CI step without introducing a separate lint command.

#### Enabled rules

- `avoid_domain_data_import` — prevents domain code from importing the data layer, keeping dependency direction pointed inward toward domain abstractions
- `avoid_domain_flutter_import` — prevents domain code from importing `package:flutter/*`, keeping business logic independent from the Flutter framework
- `avoid_presentation_data_import` — prevents production presentation code from importing data-layer implementations directly; presentation should depend on domain abstractions such as UseCases or repository interfaces, while DI wires concrete implementations
- `avoid_debug_print` — prevents direct top-level `print()` / `debugPrint()` calls in favor of the centralized `AppLogger`, keeping application logging consistent through Talker
- `usecase_naming_convention` — enforces the `*UseCase` suffix for UseCase classes under `domain/usecases/`, while allowing supported helper types such as `*Params`, `*Result`, and `*Command`

#### Temporarily disabled rule

- `avoid_cross_feature_import` — implemented and verified, but currently disabled while the existing cross-feature dependency graph is reviewed and explicit policies are defined for legitimate composition points such as the app shell, navigation, DI, and public feature APIs

Tests remain fully analyzed by Dart and `very_good_analysis`. Architecture-specific custom diagnostics may selectively exclude test paths where unit, widget, or integration tests need to compose collaborators differently from production code.

Rules are registered in `packages/app_lints/lib/main.dart` and enabled individually through the root `analysis_options.yaml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  app_lints:
    path: packages/app_lints
    diagnostics:
      avoid_domain_data_import: true
      avoid_domain_flutter_import: true
      avoid_presentation_data_import: true
      avoid_debug_print: true
      usecase_naming_convention: true
      avoid_cross_feature_import: false
```

`packages/app_lints` is a standalone Dart package with its own `pubspec.yaml` and `analysis_options.yaml` — it is loaded through the analyzer `plugins:` configuration rather than as a regular `pubspec.yaml` dependency of the main app. Because it is an independent Dart package, its dependencies are resolved separately with `dart pub get`; both GitHub Actions CI and `scripts/check.sh` perform this step before analysis.

Because it is a separate package, its `package:app_lints/...` self-imports only resolve once `dart pub get` has been run **inside `packages/app_lints`**, not just at the repository root. If you ever run analysis outside of the CI/`scripts/check.sh` entry points and see `uri_does_not_exist` errors scoped to `packages/app_lints`, run `(cd packages/app_lints && fvm dart pub get)` once and retry.

### Developer Experience

- Local CI check script (`scripts/check.sh`) mirrors the main GitHub Actions validation pipeline: dependency installation for both the main app and `packages/app_lints`, format check, static analysis, tests with coverage, LCOV report validation, and staging flavor debug APK build — validates only and never rewrites source files
- Local coverage tooling (`scripts/coverage.sh`) runs `flutter test --coverage`, verifies that `coverage/lcov.info` was generated, and produces an HTML coverage report via `genhtml` (lcov) or `lcov-viewer` (npm) when available; the report opens automatically in the default browser unless `NO_OPEN=1` is set
- Coverage exclusions reported to Codecov are maintained centrally in `codecov.yml`. Locally, `coverage/lcov.info` stays unfiltered (used by `scripts/check.sh` and uploaded as-is to Codecov); `scripts/coverage.sh` additionally produces a filtered `coverage/lcov.filtered.info`, used only for the local HTML report, to exclude generated files (`*.g.dart`, `*.freezed.dart`, `firebase_options_*.dart`) from local viewing
- Auto-formatting script (`scripts/format.sh`) runs `dart format` and writes changes directly, kept as a separate command from `check.sh` so CI can never silently rewrite source code
- Pubspec dependency sorter (`scripts/quality/sort_pubspec_dependencies.py`) auto-fixes ordering in `dependencies`, `dev_dependencies`, and `dependency_overrides` across project `pubspec.yaml` files; the built-in `sort_pub_dependencies` analyzer lint remains the source of truth for validation
- Environment health check script (`scripts/doctor.sh`) verifies required tooling (Git, Flutter, Dart), optional tooling (Java, FVM, gitleaks), `env/` configuration files, FVM version pinning, and installed Git hooks before development starts
- One-command onboarding script (`scripts/bootstrap.sh`) runs the environment check, installs Flutter dependencies, creates `env/dev.json` from the template if missing, and installs Git hooks
- Deterministic Android version code calculation (`scripts/compute_android_version.sh`) derives both `versionName` and `versionCode` from the git tag (e.g. `v1.0.8-rc.2` → version `1.0.8`, code `1000802`), shared by both `deploy-rc.yml` and `cd.yml` so RC and production builds never produce a lower version code than a previously distributed build
- Full-repository secret scan script (`scripts/secret-scan.sh`) runs `gitleaks detect` across the entire working tree and Git history, complementing the staged-only scan in the pre-commit hook
- Git hook automation (`scripts/setup-hooks.sh`) installs local quality gates in one command; hook templates live under `scripts/hooks/` and are copied into `.git/hooks/`:
  - `pre-commit`: Dart format check and a staged-changes secret scan (uses [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) when available, falling back to a built-in regex scanner otherwise)
  - `commit-msg`: validates commit messages against the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format
  - `pre-push`: runs `scripts/check.sh`, including tests with coverage and LCOV validation, before code is pushed
- Code generation script (`scripts/codegen.sh`) runs `build_runner` for Drift, Freezed, and Riverpod Generator in a single command
- Development runner (`scripts/run_dev.sh`) injects environment config via `--dart-define-from-file` and supports optional device targeting
- Release build script (`scripts/build_release.sh`) validates that `env/release.json` exists before producing the release APK, with clear setup instructions on failure
- Optional Flutter version pinning via [FVM](https://fvm.app/): a shared helper (`scripts/_fvm.sh`) is sourced by every script under `scripts/`, so they all automatically switch from `flutter`/`dart` to `fvm flutter`/`fvm dart` once `.fvmrc` is present
- `Makefile` wraps the most common scripts (`make setup`, `make format`, `make check`, `make coverage`, `make secret-scan`, `make doctor`) for a shorter command surface

### Git Workflow & CI/CD

- Adopted a feature branch workflow with `develop`, `main`, and `release/*` protected branches
- Enforced branch protection rules on `develop`, `main`, and `release/*`, blocking direct pushes and requiring Pull Requests with passing CI checks before merge
- Automated AI-assisted code review via CodeRabbit on every Pull Request to identify potential bugs, security concerns, maintainability issues, and consistency violations before merging
- Automated dependency updates via Dependabot for Flutter/Dart packages (`pub`) and GitHub Actions, with minor/patch updates grouped into a single PR, major version bumps deferred for manual review, and all updates gated behind the same required CI checks as manual PRs
  (security advisories always target `main` directly, per Dependabot's default behavior, while routine version updates target `develop`)
- Configured GitHub Actions CI for Pull Requests, including Dart format checks, static analysis, unit tests, and debug APK builds for both `staging` and `production` flavors
- Configured merge requirements so CI checks must pass and branches must be up to date before merging
- Built a release flow using `release/x.x.x` branches, version tags, automated release APK builds, and GitHub Releases
- Added a Pull Request template to standardize change summaries, test plans, and related issue tracking
- Set up Android `staging` and `production` product flavors with separate application IDs, enabling both builds to be installed side by side on the same device
- Automated staging build distribution via Firebase App Distribution on every push to `develop`
- Automated Release Candidate build distribution via Firebase App Distribution on `v*.*.*-rc.*` tag pushes
- Separated RC distribution from official production release tags to prevent accidental production releases
- Android `versionCode` is deterministically derived from the release tag (`scripts/compute_android_version.sh`) rather than the CI workflow run number, ensuring RC and production builds always compare correctly for in-place upgrades regardless of which workflow produced them
- Restored per-flavor Firebase configuration files, service account credentials, and the Android signing keystore from GitHub Secrets in CI, keeping sensitive files out of the repository
- Organized per-flavor Firebase Dart configuration files under `lib/config/firebase/` for a cleaner project structure

### Observability and Analytics

- Integrated Sentry for production-style error tracking and performance monitoring
- Wrapped Sentry SDK behind a centralized `MonitoringService` to keep feature code decoupled from third-party observability SDKs
- Instrumented key business flows with performance transactions: audio guide download, offline Drift cache synchronization, and audio player initialization
- Captured contextual breadcrumbs and exception metadata to support debugging of user-facing failures
- HTTP request breadcrumbs, failed request capture, and network tracing via `sentry_dio`
- GoRouter navigation breadcrumbs and navigation-related performance traces via `SentryNavigatorObserver`
- Integrated Firebase Analytics to track key user interactions and understand how users navigate the app
- Centralized all event logging behind `AnalyticsService` to keep feature code decoupled from the Firebase SDK
- Automatic screen view tracking via `FirebaseAnalyticsObserver` registered in GoRouter alongside Sentry
- Custom events covering tab selection, content detail views, audio guide download outcomes, playback lifecycle events, list filter usage, share actions, calendar additions, navigation requests, and reminder creation
- Playback analytics include play, pause, and complete events with playback duration and step count metadata
- Firebase configuration files are restored in CI via GitHub Secrets to avoid exposing app configuration files in the public repository
- Sentry DSN is injected at build time via `--dart-define-from-file`; local environment files are excluded from version control

### Journey Reminder

- Set local reminders for activities and manage them in a personal journey list
- Persist reminder records in the local Drift database for offline access and state recovery
- Schedule offline-capable local notifications for upcoming activities
- Support preset reminder lead times (on time, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, or 1 day before) and a custom duration input
- Validate activity date ranges to prevent reminders from being created after an event has ended
- Handle Android exact alarm restrictions by falling back to inexact scheduling when exact alarm permission is unavailable
- Restore scheduled notifications after device reboot through Android boot receiver configuration

### Onboarding Experience

- Animated splash screen with staggered logo drop, text fade, and map-themed background
- First-launch welcome page introducing core features with sequential entry animations
- Persist onboarding completion state locally via SharedPreferences
- GoRouter `refreshListenable` integration for declarative redirect after onboarding
- Returning users skip onboarding and navigate directly to the home screen

### Nearby Recommendations

- Nearby attractions and audio guides on the home screen with distance labels and nearest-first sorting
- Distance filters for attractions, activities, and audio guides: 500m, 1km, 3km, 5km, and unlimited
- Fallback UI for denied permission, permanently denied permission, and disabled location services
- Distance calculations are performed locally using Drift-cached data
- No background location tracking or additional backend geo-query APIs are required

---

## Environment

- Flutter SDK: `3.41.9`
- Dart SDK: `3.11.5`
- Flutter version pinning is optional via [FVM](https://fvm.app/). See [Local Development](#local-development) below.

---

## Local Development

After cloning the repository, run one command to set up everything:

```bash
bash scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

This checks your local environment, installs Flutter dependencies, creates `env/dev.json` from `env/example.json` if missing, and installs Git hooks.

### Useful commands

```bash
bash scripts/format.sh       # auto-format Dart files (modifies files)
bash scripts/check.sh        # local CI checks with coverage validation — never modifies files
bash scripts/coverage.sh     # generate coverage + local HTML report when tooling is available
bash scripts/secret-scan.sh  # full repo + git-history secret scan
bash scripts/doctor.sh       # check local environment
python scripts/quality/sort_pubspec_dependencies.py            # auto-fix pubspec.yaml dependency ordering
python scripts/quality/sort_pubspec_dependencies.py --dry-run  # preview pubspec.yaml sorting
```

Or via `Makefile`:

```bash
make setup
make format
make check
make coverage
make secret-scan
make doctor
```

### Static Analysis

This project uses [`very_good_analysis`](https://pub.dev/packages/very_good_analysis) as its lint baseline (`analysis_options.yaml`), replacing the default `flutter_lints` set that ships with new Flutter projects.

The project-local `packages/app_lints` Dart Analyzer Plugin participates in the same analyzer pipeline for project-specific architecture and convention diagnostics.

```bash
flutter analyze
```

- Generated files (`*.g.dart`, `*.freezed.dart`, per-flavor Firebase config under `lib/config/firebase/`) are excluded from analysis
- A small set of rules are temporarily relaxed while the codebase catches up with the stricter baseline (see comments in `analysis_options.yaml`); new code is still expected to stay clean
- No separate custom-lint command is required — both the baseline and enabled `app_lints` diagnostics are reported through `flutter analyze`
- Because `packages/app_lints` is a standalone Dart package, its dependencies are resolved separately with `dart pub get`; this is handled automatically by GitHub Actions CI and `scripts/check.sh` — if you ever see `uri_does_not_exist` errors scoped to `packages/app_lints`, run `(cd packages/app_lints && fvm dart pub get)` once
- After changing `analysis_options.yaml` or `packages/app_lints`, restart the Dart Analysis Server if IDE diagnostics appear stale; command-line analysis can be rerun directly with `flutter analyze`

### Local Coverage Report

Run the coverage helper to generate an LCOV report and inspect coverage locally:

```bash
make coverage
```

or:

```bash
bash scripts/coverage.sh
```

The script:

- Runs `flutter test --coverage`
- Verifies that `coverage/lcov.info` was generated and contains source records
- Filters out generated files (`*.g.dart`, `*.freezed.dart`, `firebase_options_*.dart`) into `coverage/lcov.filtered.info`, for local HTML viewing only
- Generates `coverage/html/index.html` from the filtered report using `genhtml` (lcov) when available
- Falls back to `lcov-viewer` when `genhtml` is not installed
- Opens the HTML report automatically in the default browser

To generate the report without opening the browser:

```bash
NO_OPEN=1 make coverage
```

`coverage/lcov.info` itself stays unfiltered — it's what `scripts/check.sh` validates and what gets uploaded to Codecov. `codecov.yml` remains the single source of truth for exclusions reported on the Codecov dashboard; the local filtering only affects what you see in the local HTML report.

> `scripts/check.sh` already runs the test suite with coverage and validates the generated LCOV report during pre-push checks. `scripts/coverage.sh` is intended for interactive local coverage inspection and is not called by the pre-push hook, avoiding a duplicate full test run.

### Formatting Policy

- `format.sh` modifies files — run it locally whenever you want to auto-fix formatting
- `check.sh` only validates and never modifies files — used in `pre-push` and CI

This mirrors how CI should behave: CI passes or fails, it never silently rewrites source code.

### Line Endings

This repository includes a `.gitattributes` configuration that enforces LF line endings for shell scripts, Git hook scripts, and the `Makefile`, regardless of the local Git `core.autocrlf` setting.

This keeps executable scripts consistent across operating systems and prevents Bash failures caused by CRLF line endings, such as:

```text
scripts/_fvm.sh: line 17: $'\r': command not found
```

This is especially useful when the repository is checked out or edited in Windows environments while scripts are executed through Bash, Git Bash, WSL, macOS, or Linux.

### Git Hooks

Hook templates live under `scripts/hooks/` and are installed into `.git/hooks/` with:

```bash
bash scripts/setup-hooks.sh
```

Installed hooks:

**`pre-commit`**

Runs fast, staged-only checks before every commit:

- Dart format validation for `lib`, `test`, and `pigeons`
- Secret scan on staged changes:
  - Uses `gitleaks` when it is installed
  - Falls back to a lightweight built-in regex-based scanner with a warning when `gitleaks` is not available

The regex-based fallback is intended as a basic local guard. For stronger secret detection, install `gitleaks`.

**`commit-msg`**

Validates commit messages against the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, ...), so history stays readable and changelogs can be generated automatically.

Merge and revert commits are exempt.

**`pre-push`**

Runs the local check script before every push:

```bash
bash scripts/check.sh
```

The local check script validates:

- Dependency installation / resolution (main app and `packages/app_lints`)
- Dart format validation
- Static analysis
- Unit tests
- Staging flavor debug APK build

This mirrors the main GitHub Actions CI checks locally, so common issues can be caught before pushing.

Bypass any hook (not recommended): `git commit --no-verify` / `git push --no-verify`.

**Optional: Install `gitleaks`**

For stronger local secret detection:

```bash
brew install gitleaks                         # macOS
winget install --id Gitleaks.Gitleaks -e      # Windows
```

If you already use Scoop on Windows:

```bash
scoop install gitleaks
```

### Flutter Version Pinning (FVM)

This project can optionally pin its Flutter version with [FVM](https://fvm.app/) to keep local dev, teammates, and CI on the same version:

```bash
dart pub global activate fvm
fvm install <version>      # e.g. the version matching pubspec.yaml's sdk constraint
fvm use <version> --pin    # creates .fvmrc
```

Once `.fvmrc` exists and `fvm` is installed, every script under `scripts/` automatically switches from `flutter`/`dart` to `fvm flutter`/`fvm dart` (see `scripts/_fvm.sh`). No other configuration is needed.
