# This project sets two flavors in android/app/build.gradle.kts: staging and production.
# Therefore, you cannot directly run `flutter build apk --debug` without the `--flavor` option.
# Otherwise, Gradle will produce app-staging-debug.apk and app-production-debug.apk.
# Flutter tools will report an error if app-debug.apk is not found in the expected path:
# "Gradle build failed to produce an .apk file."
#
# Local pre-push only builds staging (daily development environment), thereby achieving faster inspection speed;
# The complete build and verification of production flavors is handled by .github/workflows/ci.yml after push;
# The two do not replace each other, they just have different functions.
