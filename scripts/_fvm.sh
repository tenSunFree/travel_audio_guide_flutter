# Shared helper for selecting Flutter/Dart commands.

# Usage:
#   cd "$(dirname "$0")/.."
#   source "scripts/_fvm.sh"
#   $FLUTTER_CMD pub get
#   $DART_CMD format lib test pigeons
#
# Note: on Windows, `dart pub global activate fvm` typically installs a
# `fvm.bat` shim rather than a bare `fvm` executable. Git Bash's `command -v`
# does not automatically resolve `.bat`/`.cmd` the way Windows' PATHEXT does,
# so we check a few common extensions explicitly.
